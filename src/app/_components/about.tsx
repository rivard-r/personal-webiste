          {"I am currently a junior engineering student of Northeastern University looking to leverage my manufacturing experience as I enter the aerospace industry. I have had the opportunity to immerse myself in the product development process and have a strong understanding of how to scale production capacity while ensuring consistent and precise quality metrics. Through my work at Formlabs I have also developed a thorough understanding of FDM/SLA/SLS additive manufacturing and look forward to applying the flexibility and range of these technologies to my work in the future."}
